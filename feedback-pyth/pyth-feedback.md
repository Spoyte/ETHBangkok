# Pyth Network Developer Experience Feedback

## Documentation Enhancement Suggestions

### 1. GitHub Repository Documentation
#### Current State
The example repository at `pyth-network/pyth-examples/price_feeds/evm/my_first_pyth_app` lacks comprehensive setup instructions.

#### Suggestion
Add a detailed README.md that:
- Links to the official tutorial parts:
  - [Part 1: Create Your First Pyth App](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/create-your-first-pyth-app/evm/part-1)
  - [Part 2: Create Your First Pyth App](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/create-your-first-pyth-app/evm/part-2)
- Includes step-by-step setup instructions
- Provides complete code examples
- Lists prerequisites and dependencies

#### Improvement Impact
- Better developer onboarding experience
- Reduced confusion when setting up examples
- More seamless integration process

### 2. Cross-Documentation Integration
#### Current State
The main Pyth documentation and GitHub repository feel somewhat disconnected.

#### Suggestion
Add clear cross-references between documentation sources:
- Add links in the main documentation pointing to relevant GitHub examples
- Include reference links to full implementation code
- Create a consistent navigation path between docs and code examples

## API Enhancement Suggestions

### 1. Historical Price Data Access
#### Current State
The [Pyth API](https://api-reference.pyth.network/price-feeds/evm) could benefit from additional historical data functionality.

#### Suggested New Functions
```solidity
// Get price at a specific historical timestamp
function getHistoricalPrice(
    bytes32 id, 
    uint256 timestamp
) external view returns (PythStructs.Price memory price);

// Get prices between two timestamps
function getPricesBetweenTimestamps(
    bytes32 id,
    uint256 startTimestamp,
    uint256 endTimestamp
) external view returns (PythStructs.Price[] memory prices);
```

#### Benefits
- Enhanced historical data analysis capabilities
- More flexible price data querying
- Better support for applications requiring historical price information

## Additional Notes
These suggestions aim to improve the developer experience by:
- Making documentation more accessible and interconnected
- Enhancing API functionality for broader use cases
- Providing clearer paths for developers to follow when implementing Pyth
